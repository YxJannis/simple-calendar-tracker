# Minimalist Calendar Tracker

Calendar widget to track accomplishments. A tap on a day changes its color to to mark your accomplishment for this specific day. No bloating or unneccessary features. Just colors :)

Created with Flutter for Android, iOs and web. Although testing is currently only performed on Android devices.

This is very much still a work-in-progress, although the first release will have sufficient basic functionality.
